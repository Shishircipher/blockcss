color filming
A few custom properties and the :has() selector make color theming super easy to do! Add in a bit of JS and we can save the user’s preferences in localStorage, and we’re good to go! 

Of course, :has() support isn’t perfect, but we can build in a quick fallback with just a little bit more JS.
